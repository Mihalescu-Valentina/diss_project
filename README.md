# I Know It All App

## How to setup the database
- in **application.properties** write your credentials for PostreSQL
- run the backend
- run the **query.txt** from *diss_project/dis*

## Upload/Download files

- when you upload a file, the file is saved in *diss_project/diss/backend/uploads* (the directory will be created when you upload something for the first time)

- the search looks for the keyword in the content of the document and in the tags


You can use Swagger at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#. Keep in mind the controllers we wrote are user-controller, document-controller, tag-controller, auth-controller. Everything else was generated by Swagger and I didn't know how to hide those :)
